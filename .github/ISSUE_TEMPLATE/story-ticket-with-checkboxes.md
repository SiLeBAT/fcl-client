**Create one ticket for one feature. Write down small features. Create an epic for big features. State the point of view ('As a user I...').**

**Think of Tests**
- [ ] Excel testsheet needed
- [ ] E2e test needed
- [ ] Integration test needed
- [ ] Unit test needed

**Additional context**
- [ ] Mockup needed

**General Guidelines**
- Describe only one atomic unit per ticket
- Stay in the ticket scope! Be patient and write a new ticket in case of further feature requests.
- Talk with product owner if something might change for her/him.
- Improve ticket during grooming / split ticket / talk
