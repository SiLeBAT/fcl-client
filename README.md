# FoodChain-Lab Web App

## Introduction

The FoodChain-Lab Desktop application is a software for collecting, handling and analyzing food delivery data in an investigation
of a foodborne disease outbreak. Documentation for the Desktop application can be found [here](https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/index.php/foodchain-lab/).

The Web application of FoodChain presented here just covers the analysis part. When ready, it is planned to be integrated into food delivery data management
systems of national authorities.
